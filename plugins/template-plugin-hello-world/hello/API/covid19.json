Travellers who have been in New Zealand for 14 days or more can travel by air to Australia and will not require an exemption. More information is available on the<a href=\"https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/new-zealand-safe-travel-zone\">Department of Home Affairs website</a>. To enter Australia, you must hold a valid visa.

You should make your application at least four weeks but not more than three months in advance of travel and provide full supporting documentation. <br><br>A negative COVID-19 test result is required for travelling to or transiting through Australia. Unless you are travelling on a quarantine-free flight from New Zealand, evidence of a negative COVID-19 test taken 72 hours or less before your scheduled departure must be provided to your airline. <br><br>Border rules including eligibility criteria can change quickly. Travellers should prepare for disruptions to their plans. <br><br>Please check the<a href=\"https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/\">Australian Governments COVID-19 website</a> for the latest information including changes to quarantine-free travel. <br><br>*Quarantine requirements:  All international travellers entering Australia need to undertake a mandatory 14-day quarantine at a designated facility (for example a hotel) at their port of arrival. You may be required to pay for the costs of your quarantine. This is arranged by individual State and Territory governments. <br><br>Travellers who have been in New Zealand for 14 days or more can travel by air to Australia without having to undertake mandatory quarantine. More information is available on the <a href=\"https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/new-zealand-safe-travel-zone\">Australian Governments COVID-19 website</a>. <br><br>*Testing/Screening on arrival: All travellers arriving in Australia may need to undergo enhanced health screening on arrival before going into quarantine. This can include temperature testing. You may also be asked to undergo screening or testing in quarantine. <br><br>The Australian authorities provide an <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-international-travellers\">‘Information for international travellers fact sheet’</a> to all travellers on arrival in Australia. This provides information on current requirements. For advice and measures at individual airports, see their websites. <br><br>*Transiting Australia: The<a href=\"https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/transiting-australia\">Department of Home Affairs website</a> sets out information on transiting Australia, including on transit visas. There are currently restrictions on transits due to coronavirus. <br><br>You’re able to transit through Australia if transiting for 72 hours or less and you have evidence of onward international travel. If you intend to spend longer than 72 hours in Australia waiting for your connecting flight, you’re not considered to be transiting, and will need to request an exemption from the Australian Border Force Commissioner. <br><br>Due to COVID-19 related border restrictions, you can usually only travel to Australia to transit to another country if your connecting flight leaves from the same airport. <br><br>State quarantine requirements remain in place, and airport operating hours vary. This may limit how long you can stay in the airport, and whether you need to apply for exemption from Australia’s 14-day quarantine arrangements issued by the relevant State health authority. You should check with your airline, as well as on<a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/about-us/contact-us/local-state-and-territory-health-departments\">State and Territory websites</a> for the latest details and how to apply. <br><br>All airports should allow passengers to remain in the airport if your transit is less than 8 hours and on the same day. You must remain airside and you will not be able to pass customs (even to collect your baggage). You will need to maintain social distancing, cough etiquette and hand hygiene. At your first point of departure, you will need to have checked your baggage through to your final destination. <br><br>If you have to leave the airport you will be taken on arrival in Australia to a designated quarantine facility by Australian authorities. You will need to remain there until proceeding to the airport for your departing flight. You may need to pay for quarantine - you should check <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-travellers\">State and Territory websites</a> for details on quarantine. <br><br>British nationals are able to transit through Australia for a maximum of 8 hours without a visa. If your transit time is longer than 8 hours you will need a valid visa. See the <a href=\"https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/transiting-australia\">Department of Home Affairs website</a> for details including how to apply. <br><br>If you plan to travel or transit on from Australia, check the latest entry restrictions for your destination and keep in touch with your airline, cruise line or tour operator before you travel. <br><br>*Leaving Australia: You should check the Department of Home Affairs website for information on leaving Australia, including whether you need an exemption. <br><br>The Australian authorities continue to advise international visitors to leave Australia where possible due to the COVID-19 situation. <br><br>Temporary visa holders do not need an exemption to leave the country, but will need an exemption if they want to re-enter – see the Department of Home Affairs ‘Coming to Australia’ web pages for more information. <br><br>Dual Australian/British nationals and permanent residents in Australia are not generally permitted to leave Australia unless they qualify for an exemption. If you meet an exemption category or have a have a compelling or compassionate reason to travel overseas, you need to apply for an exemption in advance from the Commissioner of the Australian Border Force. You should do this as early as possible - at least 48 hours before your intended departure time. <br><br>Details on categories for exemptions, the exemption application form, and the evidence you must provide to support your exemption application, can be found on the <a href=\"https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/leaving-australia\">Department of Home Affairs website</a>. <br><br>If you’re a dual national or permanent resident who is ordinarily resident in a country outside Australia and have spent more time in the last 12 to 24 months outside Australia than within it, you do not need an exemption to leave Australia. You should be ready to show evidence that you normally reside outside Australia if requested by authorities on departure at the airport. <br><br>If you have not spent more time outside Australia than within it for the last 12 to 24 months, but still consider yourself to be ordinarily resident in another country, you can submit a request for a travel exemption.<br> <br><br>  <br> <br>  <b>Internal Restrictions:</b> <br><br> *Travel in Australia: There are currently relatively few flights between States and Territories.

Documentation of a negative laboratory test result must be presented to the airline prior to coming to Canada. The test must be performed using a COVID-19 molecular test within 72 hours of boarding a flight to Canada. Passengers without a negative test will be denied boarding.

Non-medical face masks or face coverings are required for all flights to and from Canadian airports, and within airport terminals. Anyone who cannot wear a face mask for medical reasons must be in possession of a medical certificate. <br><br> Air travellers whose final destination is Canada are required to submit their information digitally through Canada’s ArriveCAN app before they board their flight. From 22 February, this will also apply to travellers arriving by land. This includes travel and contact information, quarantine plan and COVID-19 symptom self-assessment. You must be ready to show your ArriveCAN receipt when seeking entry into Canada, as well as evidence that you have submitted your details digitally.

A person ‘in transit’ means that they: <br><br> • arrive and depart from the same airport within a reasonable time frame (the Canadian authorities advise this means as short as possible, and certainly less than 24 hours) <br><br> • remain on the air side or sterile area of the airport<br><br> • do not have to go through Customs and formally enter Canada and pick up their bags so they can take their next flight<br><br> • do not move between terminals at an airport, unless they can do so without going through Customs and formally entering Canada<br><br> • do not take a domestic flight to get to another airport so they can catch their next international flight<br><br> Canadian authorities require passengers to wear a face covering on flights to and from Canada, and within airport terminals in Canada. Passengers arriving at or departing from Canadian airports must demonstrate that they have the necessary face mask or face covering during the boarding process, otherwise they will be stopped from continuing their journey. Anyone who cannot wear a face mask for medical reasons must be in possession of a medical certificate.

People displaying symptoms of coronavirus when they arrive in Canada may not use public transportation to travel to their place of isolation. They also may not isolate in a place where they will be in contact with vulnerable people, such as elderly people and those with underlying health conditions.<br> In addition to the mandatory pre-departure tests, from 22 February, all travellers arriving in Canada by land and air, with some exceptions, will be required to take an additional test on arrival, and another toward the end of the 14 day self-isolation period. International travellers arriving at Toronto Pearson airport are already required to take an additional COVID-19 test on arrival.

Heavy penalties apply if you fail to comply. You must also produce a credible self-isolation plan. An inadequate plan would include scenarios such as planning to stay with elderly family members or failing to have a set destination. Travellers who are unable to produce a credible plan will be placed in a quarantine location, such as a hotel, for a 2-week period. <br><br> Authorities in Alberta are piloting a voluntary testing scheme for travellers arriving in Canada at Calgary airport or via the Coutts land border crossing from the US, to shorten time spent in self-isolation. Further details are available on the <a href=\"https://www.alberta.ca/international-border-pilot-project.aspx\">Government of Alberta’s website</a>. The scheme will be suspended upon introduction of mandatory testing on arrival from 22 February. <br><br> With limited exceptions, air travellers arriving from 22 February will be required to reserve, prior to departure to Canada, a 3 night stay in a government-authorised hotel at their own expense.

Some local transport authorities are making this a mandatory requirement. You should ensure that you are in possession of a mask/facial covering when using public transport in the event you are requested by transport operators to wear one. <br><br> Federal, provincial and local authorities may introduce further restrictions at short notice, including the requirement to wear a face mask or face covering in public or enclosed spaces, closing provincial borders, internal travel restrictions, a provisional ban on temporary foreign workers, or mandatory self-isolation for people arriving from other provinces.

Social gatherings with no more than 30 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 25% capacity; restaurants and cafés allowed to open to the public at 25% capacity; Evening curfew between 9pm to 5am (from 5 April), social distancing still required; pubs and clubs remain closed; over 75’s allowed to leave their homes for 60 minutes per day; Interregional travel is only allowed to regions in Stage 3, 4 and 5. You require a special holiday permit if you are travelling to a secondary home located on a region in Stage 2. <br><br>Stage 5: Advanced opening. This step relies on the population becoming accustomed to activities in COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 150 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 75% capacity; gyms, pubs and clubs can function at 50% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments. Social distancing of 1 metre; free movement for those over 75 and movement to secondary homes allowed. <br><br>The Government’s <a href=\"https://www.gob.cl/pasoapaso/\">‘Paso a Paso’ website</a> utlines which phase-out stage each comuna of Chile is under the heading (‘Situación Comunal’). In areas in quarantine you are only allowed to leave your residence under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food supplies or medical reasons, you must get a permit from the <a href=\"https://comisariavirtual.cl/\">Comisaria Virtual</a>. Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish. <br><br>The government has introduced a special holiday permit (until 31 March 2021) for residents in comunas in ‘Transition’ or Stage 2. This does not apply to tourists or non-resident foreign nationals, only to Chileans and foreign residents. For more information, please see the <a href=\"https://www.gob.cl/pasoapaso/\">official Chilean advice</a>. Individuals that wish to pass the sanitary cordons must obtain a <a href=\"https://comisariavirtual.cl/\">“Salvoconducto” permit </a> and a <a href=\"https://www.c19.cl/formularios.html\">“Health Passport”</a> (“pasaporte sanitario”) (under “viajeros regionales” for residents or “viajeros regionales” for foreign visitors), at least 24 hours before. <br><br>Information on the areas of Chile that have sanitary cordons is available on the Government’s <a href=\"https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/plandeaccion/\">‘Plan de Acción’</a>. <br><br>Checkpoints for health inspections are in force at various points around Santiago and elsewhere. In addition to checking the health of persons passing through, these checkpoints will be used to confirm that specific individuals who have been ordered to quarantine by medical authorities are not violating their quarantine. You will need to get a <a href=\"https://www.c19.cl/\">“Health Passport”</a> prior to travel and present it at any checkpoint. <br><br>*Public places and services: Chilean authorities require the use of face masks in all public spaces, irrespective of what stage of the quarantine phase-out a comuna is in. <br><br><br><br><br></p><p><b>Quarantine measures</b></p><p>Self-isolation at own accommodation.<br><br>From 31 March at 5am, all travellers (including Chileans, resident and non-resident foreign nationals) must complete a mandatory 10-day quarantine on arrival in Chile. This cannot be avoided under any circumstances, such as with a proof of C19 vaccine. You will not be able to leave quarantine early with a negative PCR.

Proof of a recent (no older than three days before application) negative coronavirus test must be provided to obtain a visa. Separately, you must have proof of a recent (no older than three days before first boarding) negative coronavirus test to board your flight to Cameroon and to enter at Yaoundé or Douala Airports. Your negative coronavirus test result should be in PDF format, clearly stating the date of the test and the type of test (e.g. PCR).<br><br> *Testing/screening on arrival: On 29 October, the Cameroonian authorities decreed that passengers coming from some countries particularly affected by COVID-19 (described as in ‘the red zone’, but with no further clarification) will be subjected to extra testing for COVID-19 on arrival at Yaoundé and Douala international airports. This is the Rapid Flow test. At present this includes all passengers arriving from Europe, including the UK. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport.

More details, including the process for submitting forms for those still eligible, can be found from the nearest Chinese Embassy website.<br><br>In order to receive a Health Declaration Form from the Chinese Embassy you must provide evidence of negative nucleic acid and IgM antibody tests for COVID-19 taken no more than 48 hours before you travel. <br><br>Reports of both your nucleic acid (COVID-19) and IgM (antibody) tests must come from the same service provider. This does not mean the provider must carry out both tests, but that the provider must guarantee both test reports. <br><br>On 15 March the Chinese authorities announced a relaxation of certain requirements for visa applicants who can prove inoculation with a vaccine produced in China. Further details should be taken from the nearest Chinese Embassy website. <br><br>A limited number of international flights from countries are flying into Beijing. International passenger flights to Beijing continue to be diverted to 16 designated airports in Chengdu, Changsha, Hefei, Lanzhou, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shenyang, Dalian, Zhengzhou, Xi’an and Wuhan. A small number of international flights are also operating direct between European cities and Shanghai, Guangzhou and Qingdao. <br><br>*Health checks on arrival:  All overseas passenger arrivals are subject to health checks on arrival (likely involving nucleic acid or swab tests). Those failing health checks may be sent to a designated hospital for treatment. <br><br>Health regulations surrounding passengers arriving from overseas are continuously changing. You should contact your nearest  Chinese Embassy before you travel if you have any questions regarding these entry requirements, quarantine rules or the requirements for individual cities. <br><br>*Quarantine requirements: Following health checks on arrival, you will then need to enter quarantine for at least 14 days. At some points of entry children 14 and over will be required to quarantine alone irrespective of whether they test positive or negative for COVID. <br><br>You will be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. If this happens to you, you should call consular assistance. Non-residents may be charged for their care. <br><br>Quarantine is usually spent at either a centralised government hotel (with costs covered by the traveller) or your home. Quarantine requirements can change at short notice and may differ from province to province. <br><br>Follow-up swab tests are likely to take place during your quarantine period. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will need to go into a government quarantine hospital. <br><br>For all quarantine arrangements in China: <br><br>•        unless directed by the authorities you’re not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 14 days. This means you’re also unable to leave China for the duration of the quarantine <br><br>•        depending on the quarantine location, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge, no air-conditioning, and limited or no internet/wifi <br><br>•        during your stay you will be responsible for cleaning the room <br><br>•        if meals are not available at the quarantine location, you will need to arrange food orders for delivery from outside <br><br>•        larger sized families with two parents may be separated into 2 rooms.<br><br>•        if you’re on prescription medication make sure you bring enough with you to last for at least 3-4 weeks together with medical documents certifying that you need to take this medication. <br><br>Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions or testing put in place, or any attempts to deliberately conceal health conditions can result in being sentenced to up to three years in prison. This applies to both Chinese and foreign nationals.<br>  <br><br>  <br> <br>  <b>Internal Restrictions:</b> <br><br> *Travel in China: Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history are in place at transport hubs, hotels, commercial buildings including restaurants, residential compounds and other locations – such locations are also increasingly needing the use of ‘health kit code’ apps to demonstrate health condition and travel history. <br><br> Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements remain for travel between different parts of the country. Some cities and provinces need travellers from high to medium risk areas to undergo 14 days of isolation in their place of residence or in centralised observation. Quarantine is enforced at the neighbourhood level and procedures vary, so check in advance. <br><br> The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory quarantine in response to fresh outbreaks is high. There have been reports of individuals who have frequented bars or restaurants where there have been confirmed cases of COVID-19 being mandated to undergo 14 days of centralised quarantine. You should keep up to date with the latest developments and this travel advice. <br><br> There have been reports of discrimination against foreign nationals in China as a result of a perceived risk that they might re-import COVID-19. In Guangzhou, in particular, there have been reports of discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, especially of those who are black and minority ethnic, including additional enforced quarantine and testing, as well as hotels and businesses not serving clients.</p><p><b>Quarantine measures</b></p><p>Quarantine requirement at government designated site.<br><br>Following health checks on arrival, you will then need to enter quarantine for at least 14 days.

Children are not exempt. You should arrange to take a private test. You will still be given a PCR test on arrival in Cuba. Everyone has to complete a Health Declaration (with the address of where they will be staying) and have a PCR test. From 1 December, all air tickets will have a sanitary fee of $30 included. If you have to pay for a PCR test, e.g. arriving by boat, the cost is payable by credit card, or in USD or GBP or Euros cash. The test result should be communicated within 48 hours. Travel insurance with cover for COVID-19 is required.<br><br> *Screening and quarantine: Tourists arriving on holiday charter flights will be given a PCR test on arrival. You will then be transferred to their hotels, and will be briefed on isolation rules there and further medical checks or testing at the hotel. Non-residents will be given a PCR test on arrival and will have to stay at a designated isolation centre (may be a hotel) until they have a second negative PCR test (the test may be on fifth day). The costs of the stay, test(s) and transport to and from the accommodation have to be paid by you, by credit card. It is recommended to bring cash in case your credit card does not work. Cuban nationals will also have to stay in a designated isolation centre until their second negative PCR test result. As will foreign residents of Cuba. The designated place of isolation for foreign residents will be specified by the relevant Ministry, e.g. MINCEX in the case of foreign business officials, MINREX for foreign media, and Ministry of Higher Education (MES) for foreign students. If your first PCR test is positive (even if you arrived with a certificate of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of your departure to Cuba) you will have to go into hospital or centre being run by Ministry of Public Health. The costs of the stay in hospital or centre (and any medication) must be paid by credit card when discharged, or payment will need to be arranged directly by your travel insurance company. As a contingency, it is worth bringing cash (GBP, US Dollars or Euros) to settle the bill.<br>  <br><br>  <br><br> <b>Internal Restrictions:</b> <br><br> *Travel in Cuba: Travel and transport within and between Provinces varies according to the measures in place. Any change in the situation in a province or municipality may mean inter-provincial or municipal transport links also change.

Visitors are allowed to hire cars (see important information in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cuba/safety-and-security\">Road Travel</a> section) but should check with the hire companies if they are open, have cars available, and check where you can drive to under current COVID-19 measures, before making plans. Check with your tour operator and seek local advice if you have questions about excursions to other parts of Cuba, including whether car hire is allowed.<br><br> *Accommodation: Hotels and guest houses are open but to a limited occupancy. Guests may have to wear face masks in some hotel areas and facilities. Campsites are open also to a limited capacity. Medical teams in hotels will check on health of guests, including taking their temperature, and will be available to guests who feel unwell in between those visits. Local medical representatives will visit campsites and “casas particulares”. Anyone with respiratory symptoms may be moved to a clinic or isolation centre and will have to pay for PCR test(s) and the medical services by credit card. Any travelling companion may be required to self-isolate in their accommodation pending a negative PCR test result, or be tested themselves. Hotels may limit the numbers of people using facilities at any one time, especially swimming pools (if open) and elevators.<br><br> *Public spaces and services: Wearing a face mask in public is compulsory or you risk being fined, as is social distancing of a minimum of 1.5 metres. Shops in all Provinces can open but must limit the number of customers within the shop.

If you have not travelled from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil and are deploying to Liberia for a period of 15-60 days, you should follow a different process: <br><br>•        The organisation that is deploying you should inform the chair or co-chair of the COVID-19 Incident Management System (IMS) in advance of your proposed deployment, of the purpose of your deployment, the area of deployment, exact location you will stay, and contact details while in Liberia. <br><br>•        You must present a negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate from an accredited lab within 96 hours of testing (i.e. your test sample must have been collected a maximum of 4 days before arrival in Liberia). <br><br>•        You must self-isolate for 7 days, beginning the day after arrival in Liberia. You must remain in your hotel or place of lodging and inform your employer if you develop any symptoms of COVID-19. <br><br>•        At the end of your 7-day self-isolation period, you must be tested for COVID-19 by the National Public Health Reference Laboratory team. Sample collection involves taking a swab of the inside of your nose and the back of your throat, using a long cotton bud, for PCR testing. Sample processing could take several days. See Testing on departure for information on test locations. <br><br>•        If your PCR test result is negative, you can proceed with your deployment. If your PCR test is positive, you will be subject to Liberia’s case management guidelines. This means NPHIL will consider your care on a case-by-case basis and you may be taken to a government COVID-19 treatment unit. Private health care facilities are not currently permitted to treat COVID-19 patients. Home-based care is considered on a case-by-case basis. <br><br>Exemptions to PCR testing on arrival: <br><br>•        Children under the age of 5 years old are exempt from COVID-19 testing and do not require a test result certificate. However, you should check your airline’s requirements. <br><br>•        Cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers with layovers less than 48 hours are exempt from testing if they complete pre-boarding testing as per their airline’s policy and comply with screening procedures while in Liberia. They must complete screening on arrival and proceed to their designated flight crew hotel. If layover is more than 48 hours, cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers must undergo PCR testing before leaving Liberia (see Coronavirus testing for departing travellers) <br><br>•        Diplomats and their families, honorary consuls, duly accredited international organisations’ staff and Liberian diplomats must present a negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate from an accredited lab within 96 hours of testing (i.e. your test sample must have been collected a maximum of 4 days before arrival in Liberia). Alternatively, voluntary testing at the airport is available free of charge. If you do not present a valid negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate, NPHIL staff will seek to test you on arrival. <br><br>You should arrange to take a private test. You should be prepared for travel restrictions, and changes to screening and quarantine requirements with no advance notice. <br><br>*Quarantine requirements: Travellers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil must stay in an approved quarantine facility for a minimum of 8 days (see Travellers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil above). <br><br>For other travellers, depending on the length and reason for your visit, you may not have to isolate on arrival. However, for the majority of travellers Liberia recommends self-isolation for 7 days after arrival. Humanitarian works staying longer than 15 days will need to isolate on arrival for 7 days and then take a further PCR test. There is a risk for foreign nationals of being put into a government quarantine or medical facility, either on arrival or during your trip to Liberia. <br><br>You are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate even after completing your post-arrival self-isolation, if you develop symptoms (fever, cough or respiratory illness), or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive for COVID-19, you may be transferred to a government quarantine facility or treatment centre. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling. <br><br>If you are travelling on behalf of government, an international organisation/NGO or a company, you should check with your organisation whether they have pre-arranged a private POC, i.e. quarantine facility, authorised by NHPIL. If you show symptoms, you may be transferred to a government POC or treatment centre. Visitors arriving on a laissez-passer (except UN or EU), may also be taken to quarantine for secondary screening. Any suspicion of illegal attempts to circumvent the process will result in removal to quarantine. <br><br>  <br><br>  <br><br>  <b>Internal Restrictions:</b> <br> <br>*Travel in Liberia: The nationwide State of Emergency has now expired.

You will be allotted your quarantine facility on arrival. You may have no choice but will be placed in the same government quarantine facility or hotel as all the other people on your flight. You will be provided with food, for which you will be charged. The exact length of your quarantine will depend on your travel history. You should confirm your quarantine requirements with the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate before you travel. Those arriving in Myanmar may need to abide by the following quarantine requirements: <br> • complete 7 days home quarantine prior to the date of travel.

If you test positive, you will be transferred to a designated government hospital for COVID patients. You will need to remain for 28 days in hospital, after which you can leave if you have tested negative for COVID for two consecutive weeks prior.<br> These rules are subject to change at short notice, and the government of Myanmar can extend quarantine periods for a number of reasons, even for those who have been granted permission to undergo a shorter quarantine period. This includes if any person on a flight you might have used tests positive for COVID-19, or in response to the situation in a country you might have recently visited. You may be required to do more than one COVID-19 test before you leave quarantine, even if you test negative.<br> If hospitalised with coronavirus, patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance.

Coco Island Region, Seikkyi/Khanaungto, Twantay, and Kwangyangon are not under a ‘Stay at Home’ order. The rules for Yangon townships under a ‘Stay at Home’ order state that residents should stay in their own homes. Only one person per household is allowed to go out for essential supplies, or two people can leave the home to visit a hospital or clinic. Only the driver and one passenger can travel in a car at the same time, unless travelling to a hospital or clinic, in which case, there can be two passengers. Those who work in ‘essential private services’ are excluded from this order. Essential private services are defined by the government of Myanmar as banks, financial services, petrol stations, livestock and refrigeration industries, production and distribution of pharmaceutical products, production and distribution of drinking water and personal items.

Contact your airline for the latest information. The Nigerian Immigration Service announced the resumption of passport and migrant registration on 1 July. The Nigerian authorities have advised that foreign nationals who exceed their authorised visa stays because of travel restrictions linked to coronavirus, will not be penalised for overstaying when they depart. If your visa expired before the start of the lockdown, you will be penalised, for the period up to the start of lockdown.<br><br>*Testing / Screening on arrival: From Tuesday 4 May there will be no entry permitted for any non-Nigerians/non holders of permanent residence permits who have visited Brazil, India or Turkey in the 14 days preceding travel to Nigeria. This does not apply to transit passengers. Nigerians and permanent residence card holders who have travelled to Brazil, India and Turkey in the 14 days preceding travel to Nigeria will be required to undergo 7 days mandatory quarantine in a government-approved facility at the point-of entry city and at cost to the passenger. In addition such passengers will also face the following requirements (i) within 24 hours of arrival shall take a COVID-19 PCR test (ii) if positive, the passenger shall be admitted to a government-approved treatment centre, in line with national treatment protocols (iii) If negative, the passenger shall continue to remain in quarantine and made to undergo a repeat PCR test on day 7 of their quarantine.<br><br>For travel from all other countries, prior to departure, passengers travelling to Nigeria must complete the on-line pre-boarding health declaration at the Nigeria International Travel Portal.

Passengers must also carry evidence of the test and result when they travel. Only a COVID-19 PCR test is acceptable to the Nigerian authorities. Also before travel, passengers must book and pay for a repeat PCR test for day 7 of their arrival in Nigeria at the Nigeria International Travel Portal– evidence of the booking will be required on arrival. On arrival all passengers will be screened by Port Health Officials and be required to provide full contact details, including their address in Nigeria.<br><br>The Nigerian government has said it will closely monitor whether passengers are following the quarantine measures and conducting the repeat PCR test. On 21 December, the Federal Government announced that it would impose sanctions on travellers to Nigeria who fail to take the repeat PCR test on day 7.  You should arrange to take a private test.<br><br>*Quarantine requirements: All new arrivals are expected to self-isolate at one location in the city of their arrival until the result of their second PCR test (which should be taken on day 7 of arrival) is known. If the second test is negative individuals can exit self-isolation from day 8 onwards. Anyone that has developed symptoms of coronavirus during their travel or later tests positive will be managed according to national guidelines for COVID-19 treatment. This may require quarantine at a government-monitored treatment centre.<br>  <br><br>  <br><br>  <b>Internal Restrictions:</b> <br><br> *Travel in Nigeria: Passengers will be asked to follow a number of additional health procedures, including the following: <br> • you must wear a mask or face covering; <br> • all passengers’ temperature will be taken on arrival at the airport; <br> • you are required to observe social distancing measures; <br> • you will be asked to use hand washing facilities installed outside the airports; <br> • your bags will be sprayed with decontamination fluids. <br> The Nigerian government strongly encourages travellers to re-consider all non-essential travel (domestic and international), during the holiday season to help fight the spread of coronavirus. Most states in Nigeria have introduced their own restrictions on movement. All travellers and residents in Nigeria are encouraged to monitor announcements by the Nigerian authorities on further restrictions, which may be introduced at short notice. The Federal Government has relaxed the lockdown restrictions in place in Abuja and Lagos and replaced them with new requirements, including a nationwide daily night time curfew between 00:00pm and 04:00am and the mandatory use of face masks in public. <br><br> Public spaces and services: Gatherings of over 50 people outside of work places are prohibited, including all weddings, conferences and sporting events. Bars, restaurants other than in hotels, events and recreational centres are currently closed. Places of worship are permitted to hold services, subject to limitations set by state authorities. On 21 December, the Nigerian Government announced that schools will remain closed until at least 18 January 2021. Visits to public institutions, including government buildings, have been limited. Additional measures include a mandatory requirement to wear face masks in public spaces.

Non-medical face masks must be worn in all publicly accessible indoor spaces, including on public transport if you are aged 13 and over. If you do not wear a face mask you might be fined €95. Additionally, on platforms and stations, social distancing of 1.5 metres must be observed. The Dutch government advises to avoid crowds and to travel outside peak hours if taking public transport where possible. For other shared forms of transport, such as taxis, passenger vans and coaches, reservations should be made in advance and you must wear a non-medical face mask. If you’re travelling in a car or other private vehicle, you are advised to wear non-medical face masks if there are two or more people in the vehicle who belong to different households. On other forms of transport, you must stay 1.5 metres apart where possible. <br><br>*Schiphol, Eindhoven and Rotterdam Airports: All passengers and staff aged 13+ must wear face masks in all areas of these airports. The terminals are only open for passengers and staff. You must not be accompanied into the airport, unless absolutely necessary for a traveller with reduced mobility. <br><br>*Ferries: -DFDS: All travellers must wear face coverings at check-in, whilst boarding, and during disembarkation. This applies for both foot- and car passengers, as well as freight drivers. On the Amsterdam - Newcastle route, passengers must wear face coverings whilst moving around the ship. Face coverings do not need to be worn when travellers are in their cabins, seated in a socially distanced manner or whilst social distancing on outside decks. <br><br>-P&O: All travellers must wear a face mask during their journey. <br><br>-Eurostar: All passengers aged 13+ must wear a face mask at Eurostar stations and onboard trains. If you don’t have a mask you may be refused travel on Eurostar services. <br><br>*Public Spaces and Services: A <a href=\"https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands\">full overview of the current Dutch measures</a> is available online. The evening curfew has been lifted, outdoor dining at restaurants and cafés is permitted between 6am and 8pm, and non-essential shops are now open without the need to make a prior appointment. The Dutch government continues to advise people to avoid busy places. Zoos, amusement parks and other outdoor public spaces will be open as of 19 May 2021, with restrictions. Libraries and gyms will also reopen as of 19 May. Most other indoor public spaces such as museums, cinemas and theatres remain closed until further notice. More details can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/news/2021/05/11/step-2-indoor-sports-facilities-to-reopen-and-more-scope-for-activities-outdoors\">Dutch government website</a> (in English). <br><br>Wearing a face mask is compulsory for everyone aged 13 and over in all indoor public spaces. This includes shops, museums, cafes and theatres. You risk having to pay a €95 fine if you do not wear a face mask as directed. <br><br>Outdoor group sizes are limited to no more than two people from different households. <br><br>You must stay 1.5 metres away from other people. This applies to everyone over the age of 18: in the street, in shops and other buildings. It does not apply to members of your household and it does not apply if you are providing assistance to someone, for example pushing a wheelchair. If you notice that it is becoming difficult to keep a distance of 1.5 metres, you should leave. Avoid busy places in general, as if a gathering poses a safety or public health risk, enforcement officers can take action. <br><br>*Accommodation: Foreign tourists are not obliged to reserve their holiday accommodation before travelling to the Netherlands.

This means you need to have a ‘multiple entry’ visa that gives permission to leave New Zealand and return, provided all entry requirements are met. Border rules including eligibility criteria can change quickly. Travellers must prepare for disruption to their plans. <a href=\"https://covid19.govt.nz/travel-and-the-border/quarantine-free-travel/quarantine-free-travel-with-australia/travel-from-australia-to-new-zealand-quarantine-free-travel/what-to-do-before-you-travel-australia-to-nz/\">Check the COVID-19 government website</a> for the latest information, including changes to quarantine-free travel. <br><br>*Between New Zealand and Australia: From 19 April 2021 travellers who have been in Australia for 14 days can travel by air to New Zealand without having to enter a managed isolation facility.

Arrivals must then test negative for COVID-19 before entering the community. From 19 April 2021 travellers who have been in Australia for 14 days can travel by air to New Zealand without having to enter a managed isolation facility. Please see the New Zealand government COVID-19 website for details. Anyone travelling to New Zealand (except travel from within a quarantine-free travel bubble) will be required to have a COVID-19 test on ‘day zero’, i.e. within 24 hours of arrival in a managed isolation and quarantine facility. Arrivals must remain in their managed isolation or quarantine facility room until the results of the test is known. You will then undergo further testing on Day 3 and Day 12 as required for all arrivals, in line with New Zealand’s policy on isolation and quarantine. Travellers to New Zealand will need to register on the Managed Isolation Allocation System as the first step to securing their place in a managed isolation facility. Before you book your flights, you need to register for a voucher for managed isolation. Your voucher allocates you a place in a managed isolation facility. For more information see <a href=\"https://www.miq.govt.nz/travel-to-new-zealand/secure-your-place-in-managed-isolation/\">‘Secure your place in managed isolation’</a>. Provision of a voucher for managed isolation does not guarantee entry into New Zealand. You must first ensure you qualify to enter the country under New Zealand’s border restrictions. You can apply for your MIQ voucher in advance. Space in managed isolation is limited and the New Zealand government is asking prospective travellers to regularly check the <a href=\"https://allocation.miq.govt.nz/portal/\">Managed Isolation Allocation System</a> website for preferred dates. There are a few exceptional circumstances in which people can apply for an exemption from managed isolation. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-situation/covid-19-border-controls\">New Zealand Ministry of Health website</a> for more information.

Tighter restrictions are in place in some regions until 1 May. The <a href=\"https://www.gov.pl/web/koronawirus/aktualne-zasady-i-ograniczenia\">Polish Government’s website</a> (in Polish) explains which regions have tighter rules. <br><br>Facemasks are compulsory in open public spaces across Poland until 15 May, apart from parks, forests and National Parks. Children under 4 are not required to wear facemasks. If there are medical reasons why you cannot wear a facemask, you must carry a doctor’s note with you explaining this. Bandanas, scarves, balaclavas and visors are not permitted alternatives to facemasks. Your mouth and nose must be covered. When outside, you should keep a 1.5 metre distance from others, unless you are a parent with a child under 13 or the carer of a disabled person. <br><br>You must also wear a facemask at all times in enclosed spaces, on public transport, in taxis or in an open space where you are unable to maintain a 1.5 metre distance. You do not need to wear a facemask in a private car. Police and sanitary inspectors are entitled to issue you with an on-the-spot fine (approximately PLN500) if you are found not to be wearing a facemask when you should. Further prosecution could result in a fine of up to PLN 30,000 for failing to follow sanitary rules. <br><br>Public gatherings are limited to 5 people, excluding households bigger than 5 members and workplaces. Private gatherings may include no more than 5 people, excluding household members. Outdoor gatherings, celebrations and events are planned to be allowed for up to 25 people from 15 May, and both outdoor and indoor events for up to 50 people from 29 May. There are restrictions on the number of people attending religious services and funerals and you should contact religious venues for more information. <br><br>Public transport is operating with 50% capacity seating to maintain appropriate distance between passengers. You can still use taxis. Facemasks must be worn at all times. <br><br>Cultural institutions such as museums, art galleries and cultural centres plan to re-open 4 May. Outdoor theatres, opera houses and cinemas plan to re-open 15 May (with maximum 50% audience capacity), with indoor theatres and cinemas planning to open 21 May (with maximum 50% audience capacity).

Customer numbers are limited in shops. This might mean you have to queue for entry. In all areas of Poland a facemask must be worn inside shops and hand sanitiser must be used where provided. <br><br>Petrol stations, car washes and car/motorbike repair centres remain open. Banks, insurance providers and post offices also remain open. Restaurants, cafes and pubs are closed, and can only provide a takeaway/delivery service. From 15 May they plan to partially re-open (outdoor terraces only) and from 29 May re-open indoors and outdoors (maximum 50% capacity). <br><br>Open air sport facilities and grounds are open for up to 25 people and plan to open for up to 50 people from 01 May.

You might find some offices are only open by appointment and you are recommended to check websites or contact the office before travelling as appointments may be limited. <br><br>The above national measures may be extended further, in scope and time, at short notice. Some regions may have stricter rules in place.

Vaccinated individuals do not have to wear masks indoors, but unvaccinated individuals are advised to continue masking.  <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210607173926/\">source</a> <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-mask-requirements </li></ul></li><li><b>Other interventions worth flagging for: </b>Guidance for fully vaccinated individuals in MA:\">source</a><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210403183004/\">source</a> <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/guidance/guidance-for-people-who-are-fully-vaccinated-against-covid-19\">source</a></li></ul><p>Regional content reviewed on 07 June 2021.</p><p><b>*</b> this records policy for foreign travellers, not citizens</p><p>** this records policies about testing for current infection (PCR tests) not testing for immunity (antibody test)</p>"]}]},{"regionid":"Maryland","longitude":"-76.687","latitude":"38.946","trend":{"description":"<b>National restriction trend.</b> As of 07 June 2021 Oxford government restriction tracker deem United States to be 46.8 on a scale between 0-100, with 0 being no restrictions and 100 full lockdown.

A Missourian choosing this testing option will order the free testing kit online, and the kit will be delivered to the home in two days. The kit is good for six months and comes with easy-to-follow instructions. Once the individual performs the collection by nasal swab, the testing kit needs to be returned to a FedEx collection site within 24 hours. Shipping is also free. Test results are then provided via email within two days.     This test was authorized for emergency use by the FDA.      Testing remains a key tool to keeping Missourians safe. Testing is not only for those who are symptomatic, but important for periodic surveillance especially when interacting with vulnerable populations and crowds. Many camps, events, and travel now require evidence of a negative test result before participation.
