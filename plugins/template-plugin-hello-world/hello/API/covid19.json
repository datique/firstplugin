You may be required to pay for the costs of your quarantine. This is arranged by individual State and Territory governments. <br><br>Travellers who have been in New Zealand for 14 days or more can travel by air to Australia without having to undertake mandatory quarantine. More information is available on the <a href=\"https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/new-zealand-safe-travel-zone\">Australian Governments COVID-19 website</a>. <br><br>*Testing/Screening on arrival: All travellers arriving in Australia may need to undergo enhanced health screening on arrival before going into quarantine. This can include temperature testing. You may also be asked to undergo screening or testing in quarantine. <br><br>The Australian authorities provide an <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-international-travellers\">‘Information for international travellers fact sheet’</a> to all travellers on arrival in Australia. This provides information on current requirements. For advice and measures at individual airports, see their websites. <br><br>*Transiting Australia: The<a href=\"https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/transiting-australia\">Department of Home Affairs website</a> sets out information on transiting Australia, including on transit visas. There are currently restrictions on transits due to coronavirus. <br><br>You’re able to transit through Australia if transiting for 72 hours or less and you have evidence of onward international travel. If you intend to spend longer than 72 hours in Australia waiting for your connecting flight, you’re not considered to be transiting, and will need to request an exemption from the Australian Border Force Commissioner. <br><br>Due to COVID-19 related border restrictions, you can usually only travel to Australia to transit to another country if your connecting flight leaves from the same airport. <br><br>State quarantine requirements remain in place, and airport operating hours vary. This may limit how long you can stay in the airport, and whether you need to apply for exemption from Australia’s 14-day quarantine arrangements issued by the relevant State health authority. You should check with your airline, as well as on<a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/about-us/contact-us/local-state-and-territory-health-departments\">State and Territory websites</a> for the latest details and how to apply. <br><br>All airports should allow passengers to remain in the airport if your transit is less than 8 hours and on the same day. You must remain airside and you will not be able to pass customs (even to collect your baggage). You will need to maintain social distancing, cough etiquette and hand hygiene. At your first point of departure, you will need to have checked your baggage through to your final destination. <br><br>If you have to leave the airport you will be taken on arrival in Australia to a designated quarantine facility by Australian authorities. You will need to remain there until proceeding to the airport for your departing flight.

If you meet an exemption category or have a have a compelling or compassionate reason to travel overseas, you need to apply for an exemption in advance from the Commissioner of the Australian Border Force. You should do this as early as possible - at least 48 hours before your intended departure time. <br><br>Details on categories for exemptions, the exemption application form, and the evidence you must provide to support your exemption application, can be found on the <a href=\"https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/leaving-australia\">Department of Home Affairs website</a>. <br><br>If you’re a dual national or permanent resident who is ordinarily resident in a country outside Australia and have spent more time in the last 12 to 24 months outside Australia than within it, you do not need an exemption to leave Australia. You should be ready to show evidence that you normally reside outside Australia if requested by authorities on departure at the airport. <br><br>If you have not spent more time outside Australia than within it for the last 12 to 24 months, but still consider yourself to be ordinarily resident in another country, you can submit a request for a travel exemption.<br> <br><br>  <br> <br>  <b>Internal Restrictions:</b> <br><br> *Travel in Australia: There are currently relatively few flights between States and Territories.

Some local transport authorities are making this a mandatory requirement. You should ensure that you are in possession of a mask/facial covering when using public transport in the event you are requested by transport operators to wear one. <br><br> Federal, provincial and local authorities may introduce further restrictions at short notice, including the requirement to wear a face mask or face covering in public or enclosed spaces, closing provincial borders, internal travel restrictions, a provisional ban on temporary foreign workers, or mandatory self-isolation for people arriving from other provinces.

New measures can be announced by the government at any time and come into force shortly after.<br><br>On 28 July, local areas (“comunas”) in Chile that were under lockdown, as part of the Chilean government’s 5stage plan, began to move from quarantine (Stage 1) into less restrictive stages. The rules on mobility in each stage are as follows: <br><br>Stage 1: Quarantine. Restricted mobility; permits required for essential activity only from Monday to Friday; Evening curfew between 9pm to 5am social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75, except on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays between 9am to11am for 60 minutes or between 4pm to 6pm; prohibition of movement to secondary home. Outdoor exercise activities are allowed from Monday to Friday between 5am to 9am and on weekends and bank holidays between 5am to10am. <br><br>Stage 2: Transition. Quarantine remains in place at weekends and bank holidays social gatherings of no more than 5 people allowed inside; Evening curfew between 9pm to 5am, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place and a prohibition on movement to other regions. Outdoor exercise activities are allowed from Monday to Friday at any time (except on curfew). On weekends and bank holidays between 5am to 10am. <br><br>Stage 3: Preparation. Under this stage there are no mobility restrictions within the comuna; social gatherings capped at 15 people; Evening curfew between 9pm to 5am social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; and interregional travel is only allowed to regions in Stage 3, 4 and 5. In/Outdoor activities are allowed. <br><br>Stage 4: Initial opening. Significant step that aims to re-open certain low risk activities and to avoid crowds and physical contact. Establishment of a new way of living: COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 30 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 25% capacity; restaurants and cafés allowed to open to the public at 25% capacity; Evening curfew between 9pm to 5am (from 5 April), social distancing still required; pubs and clubs remain closed; over 75’s allowed to leave their homes for 60 minutes per day; Interregional travel is only allowed to regions in Stage 3, 4 and 5. You require a special holiday permit if you are travelling to a secondary home located on a region in Stage 2. <br><br>Stage 5: Advanced opening. This step relies on the population becoming accustomed to activities in COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 150 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 75% capacity; gyms, pubs and clubs can function at 50% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments. Social distancing of 1 metre; free movement for those over 75 and movement to secondary homes allowed. <br><br>The Government’s <a href=\"https://www.gob.cl/pasoapaso/\">‘Paso a Paso’ website</a> utlines which phase-out stage each comuna of Chile is under the heading (‘Situación Comunal’).

Cameroon has closed all its land, sea and air borders in response to coronavirus and has only partly reopened to nationals, residents, diplomats and professionals. Proof of a recent (no older than three days before application) negative coronavirus test must be provided to obtain a visa. Separately, you must have proof of a recent (no older than three days before first boarding) negative coronavirus test to board your flight to Cameroon and to enter at Yaoundé or Douala Airports. Your negative coronavirus test result should be in PDF format, clearly stating the date of the test and the type of test (e.g. PCR).<br><br> *Testing/screening on arrival: On 29 October, the Cameroonian authorities decreed that passengers coming from some countries particularly affected by COVID-19 (described as in ‘the red zone’, but with no further clarification) will be subjected to extra testing for COVID-19 on arrival at Yaoundé and Douala international airports. This is the Rapid Flow test. At present this includes all passengers arriving from Europe, including the UK. These tests are compulsory. Results are returned while passengers are at the airport. There is no fee. This is in addition to the requirement to have a negative test 72 hours before embarkation on the first leg of your journey to Cameroon. <br><br> *Quarantine requirements: If you have a proof of a recent (no older than three days before boarding) negative coronavirus test, you will normally not have to self-isolate.

Restrictions on bars, restaurants and entertainment spots have been lifted. Visits to public institutions, including government buildings, have been limited. You must wear a face mask in public spaces and there is systematic sanctioning of those people found to have breached restriction and confinement measures imposed on them.

More details, including the process for submitting forms for those still eligible, can be found from the nearest Chinese Embassy website.<br><br>In order to receive a Health Declaration Form from the Chinese Embassy you must provide evidence of negative nucleic acid and IgM antibody tests for COVID-19 taken no more than 48 hours before you travel. <br><br>Reports of both your nucleic acid (COVID-19) and IgM (antibody) tests must come from the same service provider. This does not mean the provider must carry out both tests, but that the provider must guarantee both test reports. <br><br>On 15 March the Chinese authorities announced a relaxation of certain requirements for visa applicants who can prove inoculation with a vaccine produced in China. Further details should be taken from the nearest Chinese Embassy website. <br><br>A limited number of international flights from countries are flying into Beijing. International passenger flights to Beijing continue to be diverted to 16 designated airports in Chengdu, Changsha, Hefei, Lanzhou, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shenyang, Dalian, Zhengzhou, Xi’an and Wuhan. A small number of international flights are also operating direct between European cities and Shanghai, Guangzhou and Qingdao. <br><br>*Health checks on arrival:  All overseas passenger arrivals are subject to health checks on arrival (likely involving nucleic acid or swab tests). Those failing health checks may be sent to a designated hospital for treatment. <br><br>Health regulations surrounding passengers arriving from overseas are continuously changing. You should contact your nearest  Chinese Embassy before you travel if you have any questions regarding these entry requirements, quarantine rules or the requirements for individual cities. <br><br>*Quarantine requirements: Following health checks on arrival, you will then need to enter quarantine for at least 14 days. At some points of entry children 14 and over will be required to quarantine alone irrespective of whether they test positive or negative for COVID. <br><br>You will be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. If this happens to you, you should call consular assistance. Non-residents may be charged for their care. <br><br>Quarantine is usually spent at either a centralised government hotel (with costs covered by the traveller) or your home. Quarantine requirements can change at short notice and may differ from province to province. <br><br>Follow-up swab tests are likely to take place during your quarantine period. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will need to go into a government quarantine hospital. <br><br>For all quarantine arrangements in China: <br><br>•        unless directed by the authorities you’re not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 14 days. This means you’re also unable to leave China for the duration of the quarantine <br><br>•        depending on the quarantine location, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge, no air-conditioning, and limited or no internet/wifi <br><br>•        during your stay you will be responsible for cleaning the room <br><br>•        if meals are not available at the quarantine location, you will need to arrange food orders for delivery from outside <br><br>•        larger sized families with two parents may be separated into 2 rooms.<br><br>•        if you’re on prescription medication make sure you bring enough with you to last for at least 3-4 weeks together with medical documents certifying that you need to take this medication. <br><br>Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions or testing put in place, or any attempts to deliberately conceal health conditions can result in being sentenced to up to three years in prison. This applies to both Chinese and foreign nationals.<br>  <br><br>  <br> <br>  <b>Internal Restrictions:</b> <br><br> *Travel in China: Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history are in place at transport hubs, hotels, commercial buildings including restaurants, residential compounds and other locations – such locations are also increasingly needing the use of ‘health kit code’ apps to demonstrate health condition and travel history. <br><br> Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements remain for travel between different parts of the country. Some cities and provinces need travellers from high to medium risk areas to undergo 14 days of isolation in their place of residence or in centralised observation. Quarantine is enforced at the neighbourhood level and procedures vary, so check in advance. <br><br> The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory quarantine in response to fresh outbreaks is high. There have been reports of individuals who have frequented bars or restaurants where there have been confirmed cases of COVID-19 being mandated to undergo 14 days of centralised quarantine. You should keep up to date with the latest developments and this travel advice. <br><br> There have been reports of discrimination against foreign nationals in China as a result of a perceived risk that they might re-import COVID-19. In Guangzhou, in particular, there have been reports of discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, especially of those who are black and minority ethnic, including additional enforced quarantine and testing, as well as hotels and businesses not serving clients.</p><p><b>Quarantine measures</b></p><p>Quarantine requirement at government designated site.<br><br>Following health checks on arrival, you will then need to enter quarantine for at least 14 days.

Children are not exempt. You should arrange to take a private test. You will still be given a PCR test on arrival in Cuba. Everyone has to complete a Health Declaration (with the address of where they will be staying) and have a PCR test. From 1 December, all air tickets will have a sanitary fee of $30 included. If you have to pay for a PCR test, e.g. arriving by boat, the cost is payable by credit card, or in USD or GBP or Euros cash. The test result should be communicated within 48 hours. Travel insurance with cover for COVID-19 is required.<br><br> *Screening and quarantine: Tourists arriving on holiday charter flights will be given a PCR test on arrival. You will then be transferred to their hotels, and will be briefed on isolation rules there and further medical checks or testing at the hotel. Non-residents will be given a PCR test on arrival and will have to stay at a designated isolation centre (may be a hotel) until they have a second negative PCR test (the test may be on fifth day). The costs of the stay, test(s) and transport to and from the accommodation have to be paid by you, by credit card. It is recommended to bring cash in case your credit card does not work. Cuban nationals will also have to stay in a designated isolation centre until their second negative PCR test result. As will foreign residents of Cuba. The designated place of isolation for foreign residents will be specified by the relevant Ministry, e.g. MINCEX in the case of foreign business officials, MINREX for foreign media, and Ministry of Higher Education (MES) for foreign students. If your first PCR test is positive (even if you arrived with a certificate of a negative PCR test taken within 72 hours of your departure to Cuba) you will have to go into hospital or centre being run by Ministry of Public Health. The costs of the stay in hospital or centre (and any medication) must be paid by credit card when discharged, or payment will need to be arranged directly by your travel insurance company. As a contingency, it is worth bringing cash (GBP, US Dollars or Euros) to settle the bill.<br>  <br><br>  <br><br> <b>Internal Restrictions:</b> <br><br> *Travel in Cuba: Travel and transport within and between Provinces varies according to the measures in place. Any change in the situation in a province or municipality may mean inter-provincial or municipal transport links also change. Travel in and out Havana is restricted from 12 January 2021 through specific check points with sanitary controls, and (public and private) transport services in Havana will only operate between 5am and 9pm.<br><br> From Friday 5 February 2021, a curfew is in place in Havana between 9pm to 5am which applies to any movement of vehicles and persons.

Visitors are allowed to hire cars (see important information in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/cuba/safety-and-security\">Road Travel</a> section) but should check with the hire companies if they are open, have cars available, and check where you can drive to under current COVID-19 measures, before making plans. Check with your tour operator and seek local advice if you have questions about excursions to other parts of Cuba, including whether car hire is allowed.<br><br> *Accommodation: Hotels and guest houses are open but to a limited occupancy. Guests may have to wear face masks in some hotel areas and facilities. Campsites are open also to a limited capacity. Medical teams in hotels will check on health of guests, including taking their temperature, and will be available to guests who feel unwell in between those visits. Local medical representatives will visit campsites and “casas particulares”. Anyone with respiratory symptoms may be moved to a clinic or isolation centre and will have to pay for PCR test(s) and the medical services by credit card. Any travelling companion may be required to self-isolate in their accommodation pending a negative PCR test result, or be tested themselves. Hotels may limit the numbers of people using facilities at any one time, especially swimming pools (if open) and elevators.<br><br> *Public spaces and services: Wearing a face mask in public is compulsory or you risk being fined, as is social distancing of a minimum of 1.5 metres. Shops in all Provinces can open but must limit the number of customers within the shop. This means there are queues to enter shops.<br><br> From 13 January, shops in Havana will only be allowed to open between 9am and 5pm on Monday to Saturday and between 9am and 1pm on Sunday. Shops can only open to sell essential food and hygiene products.<br><br> Cafés, bars and restaurants (except in Havana from 13 January) are allowed to open but must limit the opening hours, the number of customers and separate tables by 1.5 metres.

In Regional Units (περιφερειακές ενότητες) where the spread of Covid-19 is particularly high and hospital capacity is limited, restrictions may be tighter or re-imposed with limited notice.  Only the most relevant measures to travellers are included below. You should keep up-to-date by checking this page regularly, and following local announcements. As restrictions may vary, you should <a href=\"\">here</a> check the latest local guidance (in Greek). <br><br>•        you must use a facemask in all indoor and outdoor public and communal spaces, including work-places and on public transport; <br><br>•        a curfew is in place from 12:30am to 5am; <br><br>•        restricted numbers are in place for churches and religious services; <br><br>•        Maximum 3 persons permitted to travel in a taxi or a private vehicle (unless all members of the same family). <br><br>•        Cross-regional travel is allowed for mainland Greece and the islands of Lefkada, Evia and Salamina (use of self-tests ahead of travel is strongly recommended but is not mandatory). <br><br>Cross-regional travel to the rest of the islands is permitted but only with either: <br><br>•        proof of vaccination and 14 days since second dose, or <br><br>•        a negative result from a PCR test carried out up to 72 hours prior to travel; or <br><br>•        a negative result from a rapid test or self-test conducted up to 24 hours before travel; or <br><br>•        documentary proof of having recovered from Covid-19 (at least 2 months since infection, and no more than 9 months) <br><br>*Travel in Greece: Travel within Greece between Regional Units is currently restricted, in line with measures outlined above. The below advice applies to any travel which is permitted within the restrictions currently in place. You must wear a mask at all times on all public transport. If you are travelling via ferry, you will need to complete a health questionnaire and hand it to the ferry operator before boarding. The necessary forms will be provided by the operator: you should contact them directly if you need further information. Temperature checks may also be carried out before boarding. If you are travelling by internal (domestic) flights, specific measures relating to check-in, baggage allowances and other details are in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus. You should check with your operator directly for further detail. <br><br>*Accommodation: All hotels are permitted to open, and other types of accommodation, including e.g. Airbnb, private rentals and hostels, are also available. However, you should note that many operators are likely to reduce their offer and close some accommodation during the winter months, particularly in light of measures put in place by the Greek authorities to fight the spread of COVID-19.

If you have not travelled from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil and are deploying to Liberia for a period of 15-60 days, you should follow a different process: <br><br>•        The organisation that is deploying you should inform the chair or co-chair of the COVID-19 Incident Management System (IMS) in advance of your proposed deployment, of the purpose of your deployment, the area of deployment, exact location you will stay, and contact details while in Liberia. <br><br>•        You must present a negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate from an accredited lab within 96 hours of testing (i.e. your test sample must have been collected a maximum of 4 days before arrival in Liberia). <br><br>•        You must self-isolate for 7 days, beginning the day after arrival in Liberia. You must remain in your hotel or place of lodging and inform your employer if you develop any symptoms of COVID-19. <br><br>•        At the end of your 7-day self-isolation period, you must be tested for COVID-19 by the National Public Health Reference Laboratory team. Sample collection involves taking a swab of the inside of your nose and the back of your throat, using a long cotton bud, for PCR testing. Sample processing could take several days. See Testing on departure for information on test locations. <br><br>•        If your PCR test result is negative, you can proceed with your deployment. If your PCR test is positive, you will be subject to Liberia’s case management guidelines. This means NPHIL will consider your care on a case-by-case basis and you may be taken to a government COVID-19 treatment unit. Private health care facilities are not currently permitted to treat COVID-19 patients. Home-based care is considered on a case-by-case basis. <br><br>Exemptions to PCR testing on arrival: <br><br>•        Children under the age of 5 years old are exempt from COVID-19 testing and do not require a test result certificate. However, you should check your airline’s requirements. <br><br>•        Cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers with layovers less than 48 hours are exempt from testing if they complete pre-boarding testing as per their airline’s policy and comply with screening procedures while in Liberia. They must complete screening on arrival and proceed to their designated flight crew hotel. If layover is more than 48 hours, cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers must undergo PCR testing before leaving Liberia (see Coronavirus testing for departing travellers) <br><br>•        Diplomats and their families, honorary consuls, duly accredited international organisations’ staff and Liberian diplomats must present a negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate from an accredited lab within 96 hours of testing (i.e. your test sample must have been collected a maximum of 4 days before arrival in Liberia). Alternatively, voluntary testing at the airport is available free of charge. If you do not present a valid negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate, NPHIL staff will seek to test you on arrival. <br><br>You should arrange to take a private test. You should be prepared for travel restrictions, and changes to screening and quarantine requirements with no advance notice. <br><br>*Quarantine requirements: Travellers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil must stay in an approved quarantine facility for a minimum of 8 days (see Travellers from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal or Brazil above). <br><br>For other travellers, depending on the length and reason for your visit, you may not have to isolate on arrival. However, for the majority of travellers Liberia recommends self-isolation for 7 days after arrival. Humanitarian works staying longer than 15 days will need to isolate on arrival for 7 days and then take a further PCR test. There is a risk for foreign nationals of being put into a government quarantine or medical facility, either on arrival or during your trip to Liberia. <br><br>You are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate even after completing your post-arrival self-isolation, if you develop symptoms (fever, cough or respiratory illness), or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive for COVID-19, you may be transferred to a government quarantine facility or treatment centre. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling. <br><br>If you are travelling on behalf of government, an international organisation/NGO or a company, you should check with your organisation whether they have pre-arranged a private POC, i.e. quarantine facility, authorised by NHPIL. If you show symptoms, you may be transferred to a government POC or treatment centre. Visitors arriving on a laissez-passer (except UN or EU), may also be taken to quarantine for secondary screening. Any suspicion of illegal attempts to circumvent the process will result in removal to quarantine. <br><br>  <br><br>  <br><br>  <b>Internal Restrictions:</b> <br> <br>*Travel in Liberia: The nationwide State of Emergency has now expired.

It will then review the situation. Residents of the UK, or those who have visited the UK within the previous 14 days, are currently unable to enter Myanmar. Those not travelling from the United Kingdom, including British Nationals, should check the requirements for travel from that country to Myanmar with the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate. If you are on a flight transiting via the UK, you will only be allowed to enter Myanmar if your transit time was for six hours or fewer. This is subject to short notice changes. Prior to travel you should check with the nearest Myanmar Embassy. New tourist visa applications are currently suspended. At present Myanmar authorities can offer business visas to foreign nationals with a compelling case. You or your employer must make your case to your nearest Myanmar Embassy and obtain permission. These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice. <br><br> *Testing/Screening on arrival: There are temperature checks for all arrivals. Arrivals must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result. Testing requirements ahead of entry to Myanmar are subject to change. Confirmation should be sought from the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of your departure. <br><br> *Quarantine requirements: Arrivals in Myanmar must enter government-arranged quarantine. You will be allotted your quarantine facility on arrival. You may have no choice but will be placed in the same government quarantine facility or hotel as all the other people on your flight. You will be provided with food, for which you will be charged. The exact length of your quarantine will depend on your travel history. You should confirm your quarantine requirements with the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate before you travel. Those arriving in Myanmar may need to abide by the following quarantine requirements: <br> • complete 7 days home quarantine prior to the date of travel. This must be verified by an employer’s or doctor’s declaration, or a self-declaration. During these 7 days you may only leave your place of quarantine to take a COVID test;<br> • provide evidence of a negative COVID test result;<br> • complete 7 days quarantine in a government facility or government approved hotel on arrival in Myanmar (allocated on arrival);<br> • undertake a COVID test after 7 days (through the National Health Laboratory, at a cost is MMK 200,000). If you test negative, you must complete a further 7 days of home quarantine, and will then be able to leave quarantine. If you test positive, you will be transferred to a designated government hospital for COVID patients. You will need to remain for 28 days in hospital, after which you can leave if you have tested negative for COVID for two consecutive weeks prior.<br> These rules are subject to change at short notice, and the government of Myanmar can extend quarantine periods for a number of reasons, even for those who have been granted permission to undergo a shorter quarantine period. This includes if any person on a flight you might have used tests positive for COVID-19, or in response to the situation in a country you might have recently visited. You may be required to do more than one COVID-19 test before you leave quarantine, even if you test negative.<br> If hospitalised with coronavirus, patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are generally expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to buy food or make phone calls. These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice. Confirmation should be sought from the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of your departure. <br><br> *Data collection: Arrivals will be expected to provide contact details. We are not aware of any requirement to download an app.<br>  <br><br>  <br><br><b>Internal Restrictions:</b> <br><br>*Travel in Myanmar: A limited schedule of domestic flights is operating, though the rules for access to these is not clear. You are advised to stay home at night, and minimise movement during the day, avoiding crowds. If you do still attempt to travel domestically, please note that you may encounter checkpoints on your journey. Prior to recent events, those taking a domestic flight inside Myanmar needed to take a COVID-19 test no more than 36 hours prior to departure. You may still be required to quarantine on arrival at your destination, particularly if you are coming from an area under a ‘Stay at Home’ order. You should contact individual airlines for details, and should comply with all the relevant guidance and regulations while travelling.<br><br>In some areas there may be local requirements for visitors from other parts of the country, including the requirement to take a COVID-19 test in advance of travel, and to quarantine on arrival. You should check with local authorities for information on possible local preventative measures. The majority of townships in Yangon are currently under a ‘Stay at Home’ order. Coco Island Region, Seikkyi/Khanaungto, Twantay, and Kwangyangon are not under a ‘Stay at Home’ order. The rules for Yangon townships under a ‘Stay at Home’ order state that residents should stay in their own homes. Only one person per household is allowed to go out for essential supplies, or two people can leave the home to visit a hospital or clinic. Only the driver and one passenger can travel in a car at the same time, unless travelling to a hospital or clinic, in which case, there can be two passengers. Those who work in ‘essential private services’ are excluded from this order. Essential private services are defined by the government of Myanmar as banks, financial services, petrol stations, livestock and refrigeration industries, production and distribution of pharmaceutical products, production and distribution of drinking water and personal items. A curfew from 8pm until 4am each day is currently in effect in Yangon and other cities across Myanmar.<br><br>Other parts of Myanmar are also under ‘Stay at Home’ orders.

Non-medical face masks must be worn in all publicly accessible indoor spaces, including on public transport if you are aged 13 and over. If you do not wear a face mask you might be fined €95. Additionally, on platforms and stations, social distancing of 1.5 metres must be observed. The Dutch government advises to avoid crowds and to travel outside peak hours if taking public transport where possible. For other shared forms of transport, such as taxis, passenger vans and coaches, reservations should be made in advance and you must wear a non-medical face mask. If you’re travelling in a car or other private vehicle, you are advised to wear non-medical face masks if there are two or more people in the vehicle who belong to different households. On other forms of transport, you must stay 1.5 metres apart where possible. <br><br>*Schiphol, Eindhoven and Rotterdam Airports: All passengers and staff aged 13+ must wear face masks in all areas of these airports. The terminals are only open for passengers and staff. You must not be accompanied into the airport, unless absolutely necessary for a traveller with reduced mobility. <br><br>*Ferries: -DFDS: All travellers must wear face coverings at check-in, whilst boarding, and during disembarkation. This applies for both foot- and car passengers, as well as freight drivers. On the Amsterdam - Newcastle route, passengers must wear face coverings whilst moving around the ship. Face coverings do not need to be worn when travellers are in their cabins, seated in a socially distanced manner or whilst social distancing on outside decks. <br><br>-P&O: All travellers must wear a face mask during their journey. <br><br>-Eurostar: All passengers aged 13+ must wear a face mask at Eurostar stations and onboard trains. If you don’t have a mask you may be refused travel on Eurostar services. <br><br>*Public Spaces and Services: A <a href=\"https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/tackling-new-coronavirus-in-the-netherlands\">full overview of the current Dutch measures</a> is available online. The evening curfew has been lifted, outdoor dining at restaurants and cafés is permitted between 6am and 8pm, and non-essential shops are now open without the need to make a prior appointment. The Dutch government continues to advise people to avoid busy places. Zoos, amusement parks and other outdoor public spaces will be open as of 19 May 2021, with restrictions. Libraries and gyms will also reopen as of 19 May. Most other indoor public spaces such as museums, cinemas and theatres remain closed until further notice. More details can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.government.nl/topics/coronavirus-covid-19/news/2021/05/11/step-2-indoor-sports-facilities-to-reopen-and-more-scope-for-activities-outdoors\">Dutch government website</a> (in English). <br><br>Wearing a face mask is compulsory for everyone aged 13 and over in all indoor public spaces. This includes shops, museums, cafes and theatres. You risk having to pay a €95 fine if you do not wear a face mask as directed. <br><br>Outdoor group sizes are limited to no more than two people from different households. <br><br>You must stay 1.5 metres away from other people. This applies to everyone over the age of 18: in the street, in shops and other buildings. It does not apply to members of your household and it does not apply if you are providing assistance to someone, for example pushing a wheelchair. If you notice that it is becoming difficult to keep a distance of 1.5 metres, you should leave. Avoid busy places in general, as if a gathering poses a safety or public health risk, enforcement officers can take action. <br><br>*Accommodation: Foreign tourists are not obliged to reserve their holiday accommodation before travelling to the Netherlands.

Arrivals must then test negative for COVID-19 before entering the community. From 19 April 2021 travellers who have been in Australia for 14 days can travel by air to New Zealand without having to enter a managed isolation facility. Please see the New Zealand government COVID-19 website for details. Anyone travelling to New Zealand (except travel from within a quarantine-free travel bubble) will be required to have a COVID-19 test on ‘day zero’, i.e. within 24 hours of arrival in a managed isolation and quarantine facility. Arrivals must remain in their managed isolation or quarantine facility room until the results of the test is known. You will then undergo further testing on Day 3 and Day 12 as required for all arrivals, in line with New Zealand’s policy on isolation and quarantine. Travellers to New Zealand will need to register on the Managed Isolation Allocation System as the first step to securing their place in a managed isolation facility. Before you book your flights, you need to register for a voucher for managed isolation. Your voucher allocates you a place in a managed isolation facility. For more information see <a href=\"https://www.miq.govt.nz/travel-to-new-zealand/secure-your-place-in-managed-isolation/\">‘Secure your place in managed isolation’</a>. Provision of a voucher for managed isolation does not guarantee entry into New Zealand. You must first ensure you qualify to enter the country under New Zealand’s border restrictions. You can apply for your MIQ voucher in advance. Space in managed isolation is limited and the New Zealand government is asking prospective travellers to regularly check the <a href=\"https://allocation.miq.govt.nz/portal/\">Managed Isolation Allocation System</a> website for preferred dates. There are a few exceptional circumstances in which people can apply for an exemption from managed isolation. Visit the <a href=\"https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-situation/covid-19-border-controls\">New Zealand Ministry of Health website</a> for more information.

If you have a high temperature or other COVID-19 symptoms, you will not be permitted to fly and may be asked to self-isolate for 14 days before you can travel. <br><br>*Public places and services: Pakistani authorities have imposed restrictions on some public activities in Islamabad Capital Territory and parts of Punjab province due to rising cases of COVID-19 including a ban on indoor and outdoor dining, restrictions on commercial activities, educational institutes and gatherings. Restrictions may be lifted or re-imposed based on the levels of COVID-19 in the country. There are mandatory standard operating procedures which must be followed in public spaces, including the use of face masks, temperature screening and social distancing. Across Pakistan, it is now mandatory to wear a face mask in public and not wearing one is punishable by a fine. There are additional varying measures in force in each province including compulsory self-isolation for people who have COVID-19 symptoms, or people who have come into contact with others with COVID-19 symptoms. In some cases, authorities are locking down specific areas. Some provinces have introduced powers to fine or arrest anyone breaking the rules. You should follow the federal and relevant provincial guidance, and monitor local media for updates. Plan any movements accordingly. <br><br>*At the airport: You must wear a face mask at the airport. You will need to bring your own mask with you. Airlines and airport authorities will not provide masks.

The Ascension Island Government will test all arrivals for COVID-19 before they exit quarantine. <br><br>Countries currently defined as being an infected area are listed <a href=\"https://www.ascension.gov.ac/public-document/cv01n-notice-of-infected-areas-18-august-2020\">here</a>. <br><br>During compulsory isolation, you will not be allowed to leave your accommodation unless directed to by local authorities or unless in an emergency. You will receive a daily welfare check from the local police detachment. <br><br>All visitors to Tristan da Cunha require the authority of the Island Council in advance. Visitors to Tristan are currently restricted to returning Tristanians and expatriates on contract to the Government of Tristan da Cunha. Tristan da Cunha has banned all visits by cruise liners and yachts. The only boats going to Tristan da Cunha are the supply vessels from Cape Town which undergo strict quarantine/sanitisation procedures before leaving Cape Town. These vessels only run 8 times per year. <br><br>*Transiting South Africa en route to St Helena / Ascension / Tristan da Cunha: See entry to South Africa. For more information on visas, contact the nearest South African Embassy. <br><br>*Testing/Screening on Arrival:  All arrivals to St Helena (except individuals from Ascension who have spent 14 days or more on the island prior to their flight) will be subject to compulsory quarantine for 14 days and will require a test at the beginning and end of quarantine to check they are free of COVID-19. For those arriving by ship/yacht time at sea will count towards the 14 days quarantine period. <br><br>All arrivals to Ascension may be subject to testing at their port of entry. If you feel unwell or develop COVID-19 symptoms during your journey, you should make the crew aware and they will ensure containment measures are implemented on arrival.<br>  <br><br>  <br><br><b>Internal Restrictions:</b><br><br>*Travel in St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha:  There is currently a travel corridor between St Helena and Ascension. Individuals who have been resident on St Helena or Ascension for 14 days or more prior to their flight will be able to travel between the two islands without the requirement for quarantine. On Ascension, medical clearance by the Senior Medical Officer is required on arrival before quarantine is exempted. In St Helena, those arriving by air (except travellers from Ascension) must quarantine in a property deemed by the authorities to be appropriate for quarantine or they will be taken to a government quarantine facility where they will spend 14 days. They will be tested for COVID-19 on arrival and again after 14 days. Any breach of quarantine may result in a fine of up to £5,000. There is no requirement for face coverings and there are no social distancing measures in force. Once new arrivals have completed quarantine, and tested negative for COVID-19, there are no local restrictions on travel within St Helena. Visitors can use taxis, public transport or rental cars to explore the island. Given its extreme isolation and lack of visitors, there is currently no social distancing on Tristan da Cunha. On Ascension you must wear a face covering from your port of arrival until you reach your isolation accommodation. Ascension’s Public Health (Coronavirus) (Temporary Measures) Regulations 2020, enables local authorities to enforce public health measures. The penalties for breaches of these Regulations consist of a fine of up to £5,000 and up to six months in prison. <br><br>*Accommodation: Hotels and other accommodation are open on St Helena. On Tristan, the only accommodation is government guest houses, which have to be arranged via the Tristan da Cunha Tourism Department well ahead of any proposed visit. On Ascension, all accommodation available to rent privately remains open as usual and is suitable for use during any period of compulsory isolation. <br><br>*Public spaces and services: Public places and services are open as usual and there are no restrictions on large gatherings. However, should Covid-19 present itself on any of the Islands, the authorities have the power to close public places and limit public gatherings.<br></p><p><b>Quarantine measures</b></p><p>Quarantine requirement at government designated site.<br><br>Arrivals are subject to compulsory quarantine for 14 days. </p>","<p><b>Health Certifications</b></p><p>COVID-19 negative certification is required for entering the country.<br><br>All arrivals must have had a negative COVID-19 test result within 72 hours prior to departing for St Helena.

Details can be found on the <a href=\"https://korona.gov.sk/koronavirus-na-slovensku-v-cislach/\">Slovak government website</a> (in Slovak only). <br><br>The Slovak government has published details (in Slovak only) of a further <a href=\"https://korona.gov.sk/zakaz-vychadzania-maj/\">easing of local restrictions</a> in certain districts in effect from 3 May. You can also check the local restrictions in each district by typing its name into the Slovak government’s <a href=\"https://automat.gov.sk/\">online search tool</a>.

During this period, you may only leave home for certain essential purposes including travel to work, to hospital or a pharmacy, or to walk a pet. You may need to show a recent negative COVID-19 test when travelling to work during this period. A daytime curfew remains in place between 5am and 9pm in the districts with the highest infection rates. These districts are marked as ‘dark red’ or ‘Tier III’ in the colour-coded Covid Automat.<br><br>The Slovak government has permitted the reopening of shops and some services, swimming pools, fitness centres, libraries and museums. Hotels may accommodate people from one household or a maximum of two adults per room, but guests need a negative PCR or antigen test no older than 72 hours. Hotel indoor restaurants will remain closed. Outdoor dining areas have reopened, with social distancing and hygiene measures in place. It is now possible to visit friends and family in other households in districts marked in the Covid Automat as ‘red’ or lower. Some cultural events for more than 6 people are also permitted, with strict hygiene and social distancing measures in place.<br><br>You must still wear a facemask of FFP2 standard, or higher, inside all buildings and on public transport, but regular facemasks are acceptable in schools and outdoors. Facemasks are not obligatory outdoors if people can maintain five metres distance or they live together in one household. You must wear a facemask at an outdoor dining area, unless you are eating and drinking.<br><br>From 3 May, you no longer need to show a negative COVID-19 test result between 5am and 9pm in districts marked in the Covid Automat as ‘red’ or lower (except for attending events of over 6 people, or going to a hotel or ski resort).<br><br>Travelling abroad for holidays is currently prohibited, and breaches of the rule could incur a fine of up to 1000 euros. You should expect extra checks and possible delays at borders and airports when leaving Slovakia, and you may be asked to show documentary evidence that your journey is essential.<br><br>For more information check the <a href=\"https://www.uvzsr.sk/\">Slovak Public Health Authority (in Slovak only)</a>.

This does not apply to children under 12 years of age. Though the Ukrainian government is yet to set out the full details, presenting this test should also mean that foreign nationals do not need to self-isolate on arrival and do not need to download the <a href=\"https://visitukraine.today/#diya\">Diia Vdoma app</a>.  <br><br>According to the resolution 1236 (9 December 2020) of the Ukrainian Government (Cabinet of Ministers), as updated on 22 March 2021, certain categories of foreign nationals are exempt from the insurance and PCR testing requirements: foreign nationals who are: residents of Ukraine; recognised as refugees; accredited diplomats in Ukraine, or members of accredited diplomats’ families; air, sea, and land transport crews; or military personnel from NATO or “Partnership for Peace” countries taking part in exercises with the Ukrainian military. <br><br>From 2 May 2021, Ukraine is restricting entry from India.

Insurance must be purchased from a company registered in Ukraine or a foreign company that has a representative office or an insurance partner in Ukraine. <br><br>*Quarantine requirements: Foreign nationals with a valid negative PCR test should not have to self-isolate on arrival in Ukraine, although this has not been made explicit in the government of Ukraine’s announcements so far. This page will be updated with further details as they become available. It is not possible to self-isolate as an alternative to the requirement to take a PCR test before arrival. <br><br>Ukrainian citizens (including those with dual nationality) and foreign residents of Ukraine must self-isolate on arrival for 14 days, unless they take a PCR test and receive a negative result no more than 48 (not 72) hours before arrival in Ukraine.

Some states have rules in place requiring travellers from other states, with high rates of COVID-19, to quarantine for 14 days or to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test. Before travelling you should check the websites of the relevant state governments. Further information can be found on the<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/publichealthgateway/healthdirectories/healthdepartments.html\">CDC website</a> .
